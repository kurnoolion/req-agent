# query

**Purpose**
Online query pipeline (TDD §7). A 6-stage chain that turns a natural-language question into a grounded, citation-bearing answer: `Analysis → MNO/Release Resolution → Graph Scoping → Targeted RAG → Context Assembly → LLM Synthesis`. Serves FR-9, FR-10, FR-11, FR-12, FR-13, FR-14 (one FR per stage). Implements D-001: the **graph routes, RAG ranks** — retrieval never runs unscoped, and the graph decides which subset of the corpus is even eligible.

**Public surface**
- Entry point: `QueryPipeline(graph, embedder, store, analyzer=None, synthesizer=None, top_k=10, max_depth=None, max_context_chars=30000, enable_bm25=True)` (pipeline.py) — `query(raw_query) -> QueryResponse`
- Stages (each replaceable by injection):
  - `LLMQueryAnalyzer`, `MockQueryAnalyzer` (analyzer.py) — Stage 1
  - `MNOReleaseResolver` (resolver.py) — Stage 2
  - `GraphScoper` (graph_scope.py) — Stage 3
  - `LLMQueryRewriter`, `MockQueryRewriter` (rewriter.py) — Stage 3.5 (optional pre-retrieval expansion; per-type gate via `_TYPE_REWRITE_ENABLED`)
  - `RAGRetriever` (rag_retriever.py) — Stage 4 — accepts optional `bm25_index` and `reranker` constructor params; per-call `bm25_weight: float | None` for hybrid retrieval [D-041]; in-memory glossary index built at init for D-043 acronym pin
  - `CrossEncoderReranker`, `MockReranker` (reranker.py) — post-fusion cross-encoder rerank; degrades to passthrough when sentence-transformers / model unavailable
  - `ContextBuilder` (context_builder.py) — Stage 5
  - `LLMSynthesizer`, `MockSynthesizer` (synthesizer.py) — Stage 6
- Sparse retrieval (bm25_index.py) [D-041]:
  - `BM25Index` — telecom-aware tokenized chunk index with `from_store(store)` factory + `search(query, top_k, filter_ids, filter_metadata)` returning `[(chunk_id, score)]`
  - `tokenize(text) -> list[str]` — preserves req-ids / spec numbers / release codes as single tokens
  - `rrf_fuse(*ranked_lists, weights, k=60, top_k)` — Reciprocal Rank Fusion across ranked id lists
- Schema (schema.py):
  - Enums: `QueryType` (single_doc, cross_doc, cross_mno_comparison, release_diff, standards_comparison, traceability, feature_level, general), `DocTypeScope`
  - Per-stage dataclasses: `QueryIntent`, `MNOScope`, `ScopedQuery`, `CandidateNode`, `CandidateSet`, `RetrievedChunk`, `StandardsContext`, `ChunkContext`, `AssembledContext`, `Citation`, `QueryResponse`
- CLI: `query_cli.main`

**Invariants**
- **Graph-first, then RAG.** Vector retrieval is always filtered to the `requirement_ids` produced by `GraphScoper`. Unscoped retrieval is a D-001 violation, not a shortcut.
- The 6 stages pass typed dataclasses — each stage's output is the next stage's only input. No stage reaches back for state.
- Every stage is injectable — `QueryPipeline(analyzer=MyAnalyzer())` swaps Stage 1 without touching the rest. Mocks (`MockQueryAnalyzer`, `MockSynthesizer`) exist so the pipeline runs without any LLM for offline debugging.
- `QueryResponse.citations` reference **specific** `(req_id, plan_id, section_number)` tuples (plus optional standards spec/section). Answers without citations are a bug in the synthesizer, not the default.
- `max_context_chars` caps Stage 5 output — truncation is deterministic (preserves top-scored chunks first), never silent.
- Graph and vector store are **inputs** to the pipeline, not owned by it — built offline by [graph](../graph/MODULE.md) and [vectorstore](../vectorstore/MODULE.md), loaded once at startup, reused per query.

**Key choices**
- Six stages instead of a single monolithic retriever so each can be tested and swapped independently — the mock analyzer/synthesizer is what makes the pipeline testable on a work laptop without LLM access.
- `QueryType` carved into eight concrete kinds (release_diff, traceability, etc.) because each needs different graph scoping and different prompting. A generic pipeline that treats every query the same loses signal.
- `CandidateSet` keeps `requirement_nodes`, `standards_nodes`, `feature_nodes` separate — retrieval filters on req IDs, context assembly attaches standards text by node, and future reranking can use feature nodes without re-traversing.
- Prompting is few-shot + explicit grounding instructions; `LLMSynthesizer` includes a context fallback path for cases where the LLM skips citations (fix kept because dropping it caused regression in internal tests).
- Pipeline defaults (`top_k=10`, `max_context_chars=30000`) live on the class, not in env config — most callers accept defaults; eval overrides. **Per-query-type override** [D-040]: `QueryPipeline.query` picks `top_k` from a `_TYPE_TOP_K` map keyed by `intent.query_type` — list/breadth queries (CROSS_DOC / FEATURE_LEVEL / STANDARDS_COMPARISON / CROSS_MNO_COMPARISON) widen to 25 because their expected hits include parent/overview reqs whose chunks are short (heading + path only) and rank below richer leaf chunks; TRACEABILITY / RELEASE_DIFF widen to 20; lookups stay at 10. Pipeline takes `max(self._top_k, type_top_k)` so callers can still raise the floor explicitly.
- **Specific-entity queries are authoritative for graph scope** [D-039]: when `GraphScoper._entity_lookup` matches (the analyzer extracted req IDs that exist as `req:*` nodes), expansion via `_feature_lookup` / `_plan_lookup` / `_title_search` is skipped. Edge traversal from the entity seeds still runs and provides the immediate neighborhood (sibling sections, referenced standards, parent containers) — the named-req anchor isn't diluted into a feature-wide scope where vector ranking can no longer surface the specific chunk.
- Cross-doc / list-style queries are detected by phrase triggers in `_classify_query_type` [D-040]: `across all`, `across the`, `in all`, `across vzw|mnos|plans|specs`, `all the requirements`, `what are all`, `what requirements` map to `QueryType.CROSS_DOC`. FEATURE_LEVEL still wins on more-specific phrasing (`everything about`, `related to`) — the analyzer checks FEATURE_LEVEL first to preserve the existing classification contract. `mention` / `mentions` / `mentioned` (with trailing space) route to TRACEABILITY before the cross-doc check so concept-lookup queries get BM25 weight rather than the disabled cross-doc weight.
- **BM25 hybrid retrieval** [D-041]: `RAGRetriever` parallels dense retrieval with a sparse `BM25Index` and fuses via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Cormack 2009, k=60, weighted). Per-query-type BM25 weight from `pipeline._TYPE_BM25_WEIGHT`: STANDARDS_COMPARISON / TRACEABILITY / SINGLE_DOC = 0.5; CROSS_DOC / FEATURE_LEVEL = 0.0 (parent chunks too thin to compete with BM25-favored leaves). BM25 filter uses `metadata.req_id` (NOT `chunk_id`, which is `req:<req_id>`) so the candidate gate matches the dense path's `where` filter. `_TYPE_BM25_WEIGHT` is empirical hyperparameter tuning, not architectural contract — values shift as the eval set grows.
- **Acronym lookup chain** [D-043]: definitional queries ("What is X?", "Define X", "Meaning of X", …) hard-pin the matching glossary chunk to top of retrieval. `RAGRetriever.__init__` builds `_glossary_by_acronym` once by scanning `store.get_all()` for `doc_type=glossary_entry` chunks (back-compat: empty on pre-D-043 corpora). `retrieve()` runs normal retrieval (graph scope → BM25+dense → rerank → diversity) FIRST, then if `_ACRONYM_QUERY_RE` matches AND the acronym is in the index, prepends matched glossary chunks with chunk_id dedup, trimmed back to top_k. Pin runs *after* the cross-encoder so it doesn't demote a chunk we know is the answer. See [`RETRIEVAL.md`](RETRIEVAL.md) for the full end-to-end retrieval architecture.
- **Cross-encoder reranker**: `CrossEncoderReranker` runs after RRF fusion, before diversity; `MockReranker` (passthrough) is the default. Per-type gate via `_TYPE_RERANK_ENABLED`. Long chunks truncated to `max_chunk_chars` (default 4000) before scoring. Off-the-shelf MS-MARCO MiniLM doesn't help on technical spec text; code stays plumbed for domain-tuned models.
- **Query rewriting**: `LLMQueryRewriter` (optional Stage 3.5) generates 3 short paraphrases (5-15 words, same scope) concatenated to the original for embedding + BM25. Off for SINGLE_DOC and GENERAL via `_TYPE_REWRITE_ENABLED` (D-039 entity priority handles single-doc lookups; rewriting just adds noise). On for CROSS_DOC, STANDARDS_COMPARISON, FEATURE_LEVEL, etc. — concept-shaped queries gain recall from telecom-specific terminology the user didn't include.

**Non-goals**
- Not a compliance checker. "Is device X compliant with plan Y?" is a separate workflow that uses this pipeline as a primitive; don't collapse the two.
- No multi-turn conversation state. Each `query()` call is independent; chat-like flows are assembled by the caller (web UI).
- No write path — query never mutates the graph or vector store.
