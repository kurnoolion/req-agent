## D-DRAFT-1: Verify SIRA on NORA corpus as a standalone sandbox, not via partial integration
**Status**: Active · **Date**: 2026-05-16.

**Decision**: Run SIRA's full published pipeline (`facebookresearch/sira`) as a standalone sandbox against NORA's MNO requirements corpus. Build two thin adapters only — (a) NORA parse output → BEIR-shape `corpus.jsonl` + `queries.jsonl` + `qrels.tsv` from the 18-Q eval; (b) SIRA's output ranks → NORA's req_id-level recall/MRR. Do *not* extract SIRA's primitives (corpus enrichment / query enrichment / LLM reranker) and bolt them into NORA's chunk-builder + query pipeline. The decision to integrate (or not) is deferred to Phase 2, conditional on Phase 1 results.

**Why**: Three reasons drive standalone over partial integration.

(1) **Faithful test of the paper's claim.** SIRA's contribution is end-to-end — DF-filtered dual-sided enrichment is co-designed across corpus and query stages, and the LLM reranker assumes the enriched candidates. Decomposing into "one primitive at a time" tests something the authors didn't design. If a hybrid wins 3%, attribution is ambiguous: was it SIRA's enrichment, NORA's retained structure, or interaction effects? Clean head-to-head answers the question NORA needs.

(2) **Cheaper engineering and reversibility.** Adapters are a few hours of plumbing in a `sandbox/` sibling dir. Integration would touch `vectorstore` (chunk_builder), `query` (rewrite stage), `eval` (comparison harness), `llm` (new caller path) — days of careful work in NORA core, with revert risk on every commit if SIRA flops. Sandbox loses → delete sandbox; integration loses → revert N commits with rot risk.

(3) **Attribution discipline.** NORA's weakest categories on the 18-Q eval (cross_doc 37.5%, standards_comparison 50%) are exactly the failure mode SIRA targets (concept queries where the right doc exists but doesn't rank in top-k). A standalone win/loss is the cleanest signal; the integration shape question becomes well-posed only after that signal lands.

Options considered:
- (a) Primitives-first decomposition (query expansion alone, then corpus enrichment, then reranker, each as opt-in NORA stages with per-phase eval). User rejected — SIRA's dual-sided enrichment loses its DF-filter pairing when split.
- (b) Dual-sided enrichment as a NORA-internal chunk-builder change, dense + graph + structure preserved. User rejected — tests a hybrid neither team designed; ambiguous attribution.
- (c) **Chosen**: full SIRA standalone, adapter-only, in a `sandbox/` sibling dir.

**Consequences**:
- Phase 1 work lives in `sandbox/sira/` (or sibling repo) — never under `core/src/`. Curated module surface untouched until Phase 2 decision fires.
- The 18-Q eval set + ground-truth req_id qrels become a shared artifact: NORA evals against its own pipeline, SIRA evals against its pipeline, same inputs. Eval harness adapter for SIRA-side metrics is new.
- Phase 2 decision tree: SIRA wins → integration shape discussion (adopt primitives vs run-as-service vs replace retrieval lane); SIRA loses → archive strand with finding entry to canonical DECISIONS noting "tested and rejected"; mixed → small targeted adoption per category.
- The proprietary LLM (100B+) becomes the only LLM in the loop for the first run. The 50-line FastAPI shim is operationally a new service surface that needs to stay alive while SIRA runs — Phase 0 finding will determine if `src/sira/llm.py`'s call shape requires a translation layer.
- Cost of running SIRA-as-published: per-doc + per-query LLM calls at ingestion; ~50 LLM calls per eval query at reranker top_n. The proprietary LLM's $0-marginal-cost makes this tractable; an OpenRouter run would be measurable $.

## D-DRAFT-2: Pass-through shim with env-var-driven mode selection — bypasses `proprietary_provider.complete()` when the LLM is OpenAI-compatible
**Status**: Active · **Date**: 2026-05-17.

**Decision**: The FastAPI shim at `sandbox/shim/openai_shim.py` supports two modes selected at startup by env vars:

  * **Pass-through** (when `NORA_LLM_BASE_URL` is set): the shim forwards SIRA's request body verbatim to the upstream OpenAI-compatible endpoint (with `Authorization: Bearer ${NORA_LLM_API_KEY}` injected and the `model` field optionally overridden via `NORA_LLM_MODEL`). The proprietary LLM's existing OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is the only LLM in the loop. `customizations/llm/proprietary_provider.complete()` is **not invoked at all** — its stub-`NotImplementedError` body is irrelevant on this path.

  * **Adapter** (when `NORA_LLM_BASE_URL` is unset): the shim falls back to calling `customizations/llm/proprietary_provider.complete()`. SIRA's OpenAI messages collapse into the `(system, prompt)` pair the provider expects; the provider's string response is re-enveloped into the OpenAI shape.

Env-var names (`NORA_LLM_BASE_URL` / `NORA_LLM_API_KEY` / `NORA_LLM_MODEL` / `NORA_LLM_TIMEOUT` / `NORA_LLM_SKIP_PROXY` / `NORA_LLM_VERIFY_SSL`) deliberately mirror NORA's existing OpenAI-compatible provider env vars (D-044 / D-049), so any shell that already has NORA's regular LLM configured picks up the shim's pass-through mode for free.

**Why**: Real-corpus encounter on the work PC: the company's proprietary LLM exposes a fully OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. With the adapter-only design from D-DRAFT-1 / strand opening, the user would have had to:

  1. Implement `proprietary_provider.complete()` in NORA's `customizations/llm/`.
  2. Inside that, build an OpenAI request, parse its response.
  3. Have the shim re-collapse SIRA's messages → `(system, prompt)` → re-build OpenAI request inside `complete()`.

That's a triple-translation: OpenAI shape (SIRA) → flattened (`complete()` interface) → OpenAI shape (LLM endpoint) → flattened (provider return) → OpenAI shape (shim response). Pure waste when the endpoint and SIRA agree on the shape natively.

Options considered:
- (a) Fork SIRA's `src/sira/llm.py` and replace the hardcoded `127.0.0.1:{port}` URL with the proprietary endpoint. Rejected — modifies upstream source, breaks the "SIRA stays whole" principle from D-DRAFT-1, lost on every `git pull`.
- (b) Always-adapter shim (the original design). Rejected — forces every deployment to author `proprietary_provider.complete()` even when the underlying LLM is OpenAI-compatible.
- (c) **Chosen**: dual-mode shim. The mode is selected at startup by whether `NORA_LLM_BASE_URL` is set. Both code paths are kept; the adapter path remains for deployments whose proprietary LLM uses a non-OpenAI API.

**Consequences**:
- The shim becomes a thin proxy in the common case (Meta-style internal LLMs typically expose OpenAI shape). Operationally this is one `uvicorn` process with five env vars.
- Lazy import of `proprietary_provider` (loaded only when `NORA_LLM_BASE_URL` is unset). Side benefit: deployments that never use adapter mode don't even have to read `proprietary_provider`'s stub.
- The shim's surface grew during this session beyond pass-through: TLS knobs (`SSL_CERT_FILE` honored via httpx `verify=<path>`; `NORA_LLM_VERIFY_SSL=false` escape hatch), proxy bypass (`NORA_LLM_SKIP_PROXY=true` → httpx `trust_env=False`), `/v1/models` handler (so SIRA's auto-detect probe in `run_pipeline.py` finds the shim and doesn't fall through to spawning sglang). All of these are corporate-environment frictions that would exist for *any* SIRA-vs-internal-LLM bridge regardless of mode choice.
- `/healthz` surfaces the active mode + resolved TLS / proxy / model-override config — single-curl debugging.
- The shim now has ~250 LOC, two distinct code paths, and six env-var knobs. Beyond the original "50-line shim" framing in D-DRAFT-1 but the additions are all corporate-friction fixes; no new architectural commitments.
- If a future deployment needs to test multiple proprietary LLMs side-by-side, restart the shim with different env vars between runs. Single-instance limitation, fine for our use case.
